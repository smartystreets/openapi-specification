            Indicates if the time zone "obeys," or, in other words, adjusts their clocks forward and back with the seasons. This information is particularly useful to determine time in other time zones with areas that may or may not use daylight saving time - for example, Arizona, Hawaii, and, of all places, Indiana. 

            true â€” Time zone observes daylight saving time. 

            If dst is absent from the response, then time zone does not observe daylight saving time.

            Status of the Delivery Point Validation (DPV). This indicates whether or not the address is present in the USPS data. 

            Y â€” Confirmed; entire address is present in the USPS data. (To be certain the address is actually deliverable, verify that the dpv_vacant field has a value of N. You may also want to verify that the dpv_no_stat field has a value of N. However, the USPS is often several months behind in updating this data point, so only rely on the dpv_no_stat data if you are fully aware of its weaknesses and limitations.) 
            (e.g., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy Mountain View, CA)
            N â€” Not confirmed; address is not present in the USPS data.
            S â€” Confirmed by ignoring secondary info; the main address is present in the USPS data, but the submitted secondary information (apartment, suite, etc.) was not recognized.

            Indicates that a delivery point was active in the past but is currently vacant (in most cases, unoccupied over 90 days) and is not receiving deliveries. This status is often obtained when mail receptacles aren't being emptied and are filling up, so mail is held at the post office for a certain number of days before the delivery point is marked vacant. 

            Y â€” Address is vacant.
            N â€” Address is not vacant.

          maxLength: 1
          description: |-
            Indicates that a delivery point is listed as "no-stat" by the USPS. Technically, that means the USPS is temporarily declaring the address undeliverable. In practice, however, the USPS is often several months behind in removing addresses from the "no-stat" list, so only rely on this data point if you are fully aware of its weaknesses and limitations. 

            Y â€” USPS lists the address as "no-stat."
            N â€” USPS does not list the address as "no-stat."

            The reason for the LACSLink indication that was given (below) 

            A â€” Match: Address provided. LACSLink record match was found, and a converted address was provided.
            00 â€” No Match. No converted address. No soup for you!
            09 â€” Match: No new address. LACSLink matched an input address to an old address which is a "high-rise default" address; no new address was provided.
            14 â€” Match: No conversion. Found a LACSLink record, but couldn't convert the data to a deliverable address.
            92 â€” Match: Dropped secondary number. LACSLink record was matched after dropping the secondary number from input.
            [blank] â€” No LACSLink lookup attempted.

            Indicates whether there is an address match in the LACSLink database. 

            Y â€” LACS record match; a new address could be furnished because the input record matched a record in the master file.
            S â€” LACS record - secondary number dropped; the record is a ZIP+4 street level or high-rise match. The input record matched a master file record, but the input address had a secondary number and the master file record did not.
            N â€” No match; a new address could not be furnished; the input record could not be matched to a record in the master file.
            F â€” False positive; a false positive record was detected.
            [blank] â€” No LACSLink lookup attempted.

          maxLength: 5
          description: |-
            Indicates a match (or not) to the USPS SuiteLink data. SuiteLink attempts to provide secondary information such as "suite" or "apartment" whenever there is a match based on address and company name. 

            true â€” There was a SuiteLink match and the result is provided.
            false â€” There was no SuiteLink match.

            When an address is submitted with the match parameter set to "enhanced," this field will contain additional information about the result. Multiple values may be present, separated by commas. Additional values will be added from time to time. The current possible values are:

            [blank] â€” Enhanced matching was not performed because it was unnecessary to obtain a match.
            none â€” Enhanced matching was performed but no address match was found.
            non-postal-match â€” Enhanced matching was performed and a match was found within additional, non-postal address data.
            postal-match â€” Enhanced matching was performed and a match was found within postal address data.
            missing-secondary â€” The address should have a secondary (e.g., apartment), but none was found in the input.
            unknown-secondary â€” The provided secondary information did not match a known secondary within the address data.
            ignored-input â€” The provided input contained information that was not used for a match.
