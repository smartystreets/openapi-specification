        accuracy:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Type: varchar(18)

            Info: Indicates the accuracy of the latitude and longitude values. 

            Unknown — Coordinates not known. Reasons could include: lat/lon coordinates not available.
            Zip5 — Accurate to a 5-digit ZIP Code level (least accurate)
            Zip6 — Accurate to a 6-digit ZIP Code level
            Zip7 — Accurate to a 7-digit ZIP Code level
            Zip8 — Accurate to an 8-digit ZIP Code level
            Zip9 — Accurate to a 9-digit ZIP Code level
            Parcel — Accurate to the centroid of a property parcel.
            Rooftop — Accurate to the rooftop of a structure for this address.

            Note: Concerning addresses for which the ZIP9 accuracy is not available, the ZIP# accuracy is interpolated based on neighboring addresses. Thus, ZIP7 is an average of all the lat/long coordinates of nearby ZIP Codes that share those first 7 digits.
