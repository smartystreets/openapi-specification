        To send one (and only one) address to our API, simply encode the input field names from the table below along with the corresponding input values as query string parameters in the URL of your request. Here's an example that uses the street, city, state, and candidates fields (line breaks added for readability):
        ```
        curl -v 'https://us-street.api.smarty.com/street-address?
          auth-id=YOUR+AUTH-ID+HERE&
          auth-token=YOUR+AUTH-TOKEN+HERE&
          street=1600+amphitheatre+pkwy&
          city=mountain+view&
          state=CA&
          candidates=10'
        ```
        Please note that all query string parameter values must be url-encoded (spaces become + or %20, for example) to ensure that the data is transferred correctly. A common mistake we see is a non-encoded pound sign (#) like in an apartment number (# 409). This character, when properly encoded in a URL, becomes %23. When not encoded this character functions as the fragment identifier, which is ignored by our API servers.

            14 — Match: No conversion. Found a LACSLink record, but couldn't convert the data to a deliverable address.
            92 — Match: Dropped secondary number. LACSLink record was matched after dropping the secondary number from input.

            Indicates whether there is an address match in the LACSLink database. 

            Y — LACS record match; a new address could be furnished because the input record matched a record in the master file.
            S — LACS record - secondary number dropped; the record is a ZIP+4 street level or high-rise match. The input record matched a master file record, but the input address had a secondary number and the master file record did not.
            N — No match; a new address could not be furnished; the input record could not be matched to a record in the master file.
            F — False positive; a false positive record was detected.

            non-postal-match — A match was found within additional, non-postal address data.
            postal-match — A match was found within postal address data.
            missing-secondary — The address should have a secondary (e.g., apartment), but none was found in the input.
            unknown-secondary — The provided secondary information did not match a known secondary within the address data.

            invalid  The API will return detailed output for both valid and invalid addresses. To find out if the address is valid, check the dpv_match_code. Values of Y, S, or D indicate a valid address.

      description: "A POST request allows a larger volume of data (MAX: 100 addresses or 32K per request) to be sent in the HTTP Request Body. In this case, the data should be encoded as a JSON array where each element in the array is a JSON object with field names identical to those in the field listing below. Here's a sample request with two addresses being sent (line breaks added for readability):\n\ncurl -v 'https://us-street.api.smarty.com/street-address?\n\t\tauth-id=YOUR+AUTH-ID+HERE&\n\t\tauth-token=YOUR+AUTH-TOKEN+HERE&\n\t\tlicense=YOUR+LICENSE+HERE&'\n\t-H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\"\n\t--data-binary '\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"street\":\"1 Santa Claus\",\n\t\t\t\"city\":\"North Pole\",\n\t\t\t\"state\":\"AK\",\n\t\t\t\"candidates\":10\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"addressee\":\"Apple Inc\",\n\t\t\t\"street\":\"1 infinite loop\",\n\t\t\t\"city\":\"cupertino\",\n\t\t\t\"state\":\"CA\",\n\t\t\t\"zipcode\":\"95014\",\n\t\t\t\"candidates\":10\n\t\t}\n\t]'\n"
