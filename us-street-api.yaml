        To send one (and only one) address to our API, simply encode the input field names from the table below along with the corresponding input values as query string parameters in the URL of your request. Here's an example that uses the street, city, state, and candidates fields (line breaks added for readability):

        curl -v 'https://us-street.api.smartystreets.com/street-address?auth-id=YOUR+AUTH-ID+HERE&auth-token=YOUR+AUTH-TOKEN+HERE&license=YOUR+LICENSE+HERE&street=1600+amphitheatre+pkwy&city=mountain+view&state=CA&candidates=10'

        Please note that all query string parameter values must be url-encoded (spaces become + or %20, for example) to ensure that the data is transferred correctly. A common mistake we see is a non-encoded pound sign (#) like in an apartment number (# 409). This character, when properly encoded in a URL, becomes %23. When not encoded this character functions as the fragment identifier, which is ignored by our API servers.

            Zip5 — Accurate to a 5-digit ZIP Code level (least precise)
            Zip6 — Accurate to a 6-digit ZIP Code level

This information is particularly useful to determine time in other time zones with areas that may or may not use daylight saving time - for example, Arizona, Hawaii, and, of all places, Indiana. 

            true — Time zone observes daylight saving time. 

            If dst is absent from the response, then time zone does not observe daylight saving time.

            Status of the Delivery Point Validation (DPV). This indicates whether or not the address is present in the USPS data.

            Y — Address is associated with a valid CMRA.

            Indicates that a delivery point was active in the past but is currently vacant (in most cases, unoccupied over 90 days) and is not receiving deliveries. This status is often obtained when mail receptacles aren't being emptied and are filling up, so mail is held at the post office for a certain number of days before the delivery point is marked vacant. 

            Y — Address is vacant.
            N — Address is not vacant.
            [blank] — Address was not submitted for vacancy verification.

          maxLength: 1
          description: |-
            Indicates that a delivery point is listed as "no-stat" by the USPS. Technically, that means the USPS is temporarily declaring the address undeliverable. In practice, however, the USPS is often several months behind in removing addresses from the "no-stat" list, so only rely on this data point if you are fully aware of its weaknesses and limitations. 

            Y — USPS lists the address as "no-stat."
            N — USPS does not list the address as "no-stat."
            [blank] — Address was not submitted for "no-stat" verification.

            00 — No Match. No converted address. No soup for you!
            09 — Match: No new address. LACSLink matched an input address to an old address which is a "high-rise default" address; no new address was provided.
            14 — Match: No conversion. Found a LACSLink record, but couldn't convert the data to a deliverable address.
            92 — Match: Dropped secondary number. LACSLink record was matched after dropping the secondary number from input.
            [blank] — No LACSLink lookup attempted.

          description: |-
            Indicates whether there is an address match in the LACSLink database. 

            Y — LACS record match; a new address could be furnished because the input record matched a record in the master file.
            S — LACS record - secondary number dropped; the record is a ZIP+4 street level or high-rise match. The input record matched a master file record, but the input address had a secondary number and the master file record did not.
            N — No match; a new address could not be furnished; the input record could not be matched to a record in the master file.
            F — False positive; a false positive record was detected.
            [blank] — No LACSLink lookup attempted.

          type: string
          maxLength: 5
          description: |-
            Indicates a match (or not) to the USPS SuiteLink data. SuiteLink attempts to provide secondary information such as "suite" or "apartment" whenever there is a match based on address and company name. 

            true — There was a SuiteLink match and the result is provided.
            false — There was no SuiteLink match.

            When an address is submitted with the match parameter set to "enhanced," this field will contain additional information about the result. Multiple values may be present, separated by commas. Additional values will be added from time to time. The current possible values are:

            [blank] — Enhanced matching was not performed because it was unnecessary to obtain a match.
            none — Enhanced matching was performed but no address match was found.
            non-postal-match — Enhanced matching was performed and a match was found within additional, non-postal address data.
            postal-match — Enhanced matching was performed and a match was found within postal address data.
            missing-secondary — The address should have a secondary (e.g., apartment), but none was found in the input.
            unknown-secondary — The provided secondary information did not match a known secondary within the address data.
            ignored-input — The provided input contained information that was not used for a match.

                  strict  The API will return detailed output only if a valid match is found. Otherwise the API response will be an empty array.
                  invalid  The API will return detailed output for both valid and invalid addresses. To find out if the address is valid, check the dpv_match_code. Values of Y, S, or D indicate a valid address. 
                  enhanced  The API will return detailed output based on a more aggressive matching mechanism. It also includes a more comprehensive address dataset beyond just the postal address data. Requires a US Core license or a US Rooftop Geocoding license. Note: A freeform address, that we can't find a match for, will respond with an empty
                  array, "[]".
                  Notes:
                  (1) The invalid setting is not compatible with freeform address input. For all addresses submitted freeform, the API will automatically employ a strict match output strategy.
                  (2) When submitting addresses in components, setting match to invalid will prevent the API from finding valid matches for ambiguous address input.

        street + city + state
        street + zipcode
